For creation of C-Play in general:
Erik Sundén.
As a manager and developer of specialized immersive arenas, relying on general media tools to do your bidding is not always easy.
However, you also do not want to be stuck with limitation that comes with the limited time one person or small team can produce, compared to a commerical company.
Without open-source libraries to be the puzzle pieces of this unqiue media player, the ease-of-use and high performance would not be possible.

So special thanks to:
Alexander Bock, for extensive work on SGCT (simple graphics cluster toolkit) and creation of C-Troll (to manage launch in clustered environments).
Miroslav Andel, creator of SGCT.
George Florea Bănuș, creator of Haruna, a good foundation for the master UI of C-Play and showcase on how you embed libmpv in QML/Qt app.
And above all, big thanks to all the people behind MPV and FFmpeg, and the ongoing effort in high performance media playback.
