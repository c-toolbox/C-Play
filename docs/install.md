# Installation instructions

Please download the latest release from [Github](https://github.com/c-toolbox/C-Play/releases).

From 2.0 and on-wards there is a installer available for Windows.
Please install that in the exact same paths on all systems, master and clients.

To launch application on master+nodes, we normally use an own developed application called [C-Troll](https://github.com/c-toolbox/C-Troll).

It's recommended that you first go-through the [setup guide](setup), as well as to learn how C-Play [handles and structures media](media).

When that is done, make sure you understand the application specific [settings](settings), for instance, the specifying the [locations](guides/settings/location.md) for C-Play to save and look for *cplaylists* and *cplayfiles*.

Hopefully the [playback](playback) features should be clear after this.
