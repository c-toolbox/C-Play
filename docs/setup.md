# Setup C-Play

While C-Play is designed to be a media player used for clustered environments, there is not an additional program within C-Play to launch C-Play on the different machines in a synchronized manor.

However, we have a perfect additional system for that, called [C-Troll](https://github.com/c-toolbox/C-Troll), that can launch any program on multiple computers with various configuration options.

Thus, C-Play could be launched on multiple machines with various configuration utilizing C-Troll as the start/stop program utility.
