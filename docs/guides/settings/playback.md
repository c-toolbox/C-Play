# Playback settings

![Playback settings](assets/ui/settings/playback.png) 

The playback settings within C-Play handles timing of fades, loops and seeks as well indicate which MPV configuration has been loaded and what it contains.

What time the fade up/down should take is all very user dependent, while the time sync settings very much depend on how powerful your computer setup is.

For more knowledge into what changes in mpv configuration can affect playback, see the
[Video configuration guide](../setup/video.md).
